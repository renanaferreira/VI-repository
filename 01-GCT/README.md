# 1. Basic Charts
## 1.2. Bar Charts
Maybe the interval is too wide to represent the data correctly. Maybe trying to short it might help.
Bar charts, in order to represent the difference between the numeric values, must have shorter intervals in order to highlight this difference to viewers.

Another thing to think about is that the numeric values themselves are not supported in a pass-the-mouse legend, or even to put some colors to represent 
some intervals, like red to 20-30 range.
#TODO Research more about it.
